"AC-ADN-0001","Addonics 2.5"" Dual mSATA Flash Drive Kit","This Dual mSATA - SATA Adapter is designed to enable two mSATA (mini SATA) SSDs to be installed into the space of a 2.5"" hard drive. The two mSATA SSD can be configured to form a single RAID volume and used as a direct replacement for the 2.5"" SATA hard drive. The Dual mSATA - SATA adapter is capable of performance up to 6 Gbps and allows the mSATA card to be used as bootable SSD. The adapter comes with two 7 mm height mounting rails that have the same mounting holes location as on standard 2.5"" hard drive. As a result, any equipment such as Notebook computer that uses a 2.5"" SATA hard drive as thin as 7 mm., can be easily replaced with the low power, high performance and shock resistant mSATA card, When connecting to a Port Multiplier compatible SATA port, the two mSATA SSDs can also be set up to operate as two independent drives.","ea",,"Inventory","true","N","1","lbs","0","0","0","ft",,,,"false","false","false","false",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"AC-ADN-0001-UF","Addonics 2.5"" Dual mSATA Flash Drive Kit","This Dual mSATA - SATA Adapter is designed to enable two mSATA (mini SATA) SSDs to be installed into the space of a 2.5"" hard drive. The two mSATA SSD can be configured to form a single RAID volume and used as a direct replacement for the 2.5"" SATA hard drive. The Dual mSATA - SATA adapter is capable of performance up to 6 Gbps and allows the mSATA card to be used as bootable SSD. The adapter comes with two 7 mm height mounting rails that have the same mounting holes location as on standard 2.5"" hard drive. As a result, any equipment such as Notebook computer that uses a 2.5"" SATA hard drive as thin as 7 mm., can be easily replaced with the low power, high performance and shock resistant mSATA card, When connecting to a Port Multiplier compatible SATA port, the two mSATA SSDs can also be set up to operate as two independent drives.","ea",,"Inventory","true","N","1","lbs","0","0","0","ft",,,,"false","false","false","false",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
